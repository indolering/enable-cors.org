<p>
				If you don't have access to configure Apache, you can still send the header from a PHP script. It's a case of adding the following to your PHP scripts:
			</p>
			<pre class="code"> &lt;?php
 header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");</pre>
			<p class="note">
				Note: as with all uses of the PHP <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php">header function</a>, this must be before any output has been sent from the server.
